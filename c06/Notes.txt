/**
 * An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be 
 * replaced with its corresponding value without changing the 
 * program's behavior.[1] As a result, evaluating a referentially 
 * transparent function gives the same value for same arguments. 
 * Such functions are called pure functions. 
 * An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.
