/**
 * An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be 
 * replaced with its corresponding value without changing the 
 * program's behavior.[1] As a result, evaluating a referentially 
 * transparent function gives the same value for same arguments. 
 * Such functions are called pure functions. 
 * An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.  
 *
 * In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function 
 * (also functional, functional form or functor) is a function that does at least 
 * one of the following: 
 * -  takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e., procedural parameters),
 * -  returns a function as its result.
